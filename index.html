      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a scriot</li>
        <li>Comments: Comments allow you to add notes or hints to JavaScript code. When executing the code, the JavaScript engine ignores the comments.</li>
        <li>Single-line Comments: A single-line comment starts with two forward-slashes characters (//). A single-line comment makes all the text following the // on the same line into a comment. For example: // this is a single-line comment</li>
        <li>Block Comments: A delimited comment begins with a forward slash and asterisk /* and ends with the opposite */ as in the following example:
            /* This is a block comment
               that can span multiple lines */</li>
        <li>Identifier's: An identifier is a name you choose for variables, parameters, functions, classes, etc. Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, the message is different from the Message</li>
        <li>Whitespace: Whitespace refers to characters that provide the space between other characters. JavaScript has the following whitespace:

            Carriage return
            Space
            New Line
            tab
            
            JavaScript engine ignores whitespace. However, you can use whitespace to format the code to make it easy to read and maintain.</li>
        <li>Statments: A statement is a code that declares a variable or instructs the JavaScript engine to do a task. A simple statement is terminated by a semicolon (;).
            Although the semicolon (;) is optional; you should always use it to terminate a statement</li>
        <li>Blocks: A block is a sequence of zero or more simple statements. A block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets {}</li>
        <li>Keywords & Reserved words: JavaScript defines a list of reserved keywords that have specific uses. Therefore, you cannot use the reserved keywords as identifiers or property names by rules.
            The following list shows the JavaScript reserved words defined in ECMA-262:<br>

               [break, case,	catch,
                continue, debugger, default,
                else,	export,	extends,
                function,	if,	import,
                new, return,	super,
                throw, try, null,
                void, while, with,
                class, delete, finally,
                in, switch, typeof,
                yield, const, do
                for,	instanceof, this,
                var].<br>
            Future Reserve Keywords: that cannot be used as identifiers or property names:<br>
              
            [enum,	implements,	let
            protected,	private,	public
            await,	interface,	package
            implements,	public].<br>
                  
Do not use the reserved keywords and reserved words for identifers.
